1. Working from the test data, complete the Excel spreadsheet by inserting the correct values in the "Profile Lengths", "Profile Means", "User Similarities", and "Predictions" tabs. (Ignore the others)
2. Insert the correct values from these calculations into the test_User_KNN.py test case.
3. Implement the missing functionality in User_KNN.py. I recommend working one function at a time, verifying against the test case.
4. When your User_KNN class is working, then run the Juypter notebook. Anticipate that the "fit()" call will take at least 15 minutes to run, possibly longer depending on your hardware.
